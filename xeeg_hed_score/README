# BIDS example with HED-SCORE schema library annotations

The HED schema library for the Standardized Computer-based Organized Reporting of EEG (SCORE) can be used to add annotations for BIDS datasets. The annotations are machine readable and validated with the BIDS and HED validators. 

The examples are related to the following preprint:
Attia TP, Robbins K, Beniczky S, Bosch-Bayard J, Delorme A, Lundstrom BN, Rogers C, Rampp S, Valdes-Sosa P, Truong D, Worrell G, Makeig S, Hermes D. Hierarchical Event Descriptor library schema for EEG data annotation. arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.15173. 2023 Oct 4.

# General information
This BIDS example set includes 3 subjects where EEG data are annotated according to the HED-SCORE schema library:
- Example subject with annotated Seizures.
- Example subject with annotated Artifacts.
- Example subject with an annotated Modulator (photic stimulation).

Data are annotated by adding a column for annotations in the _events.tsv. This levels/annotations in this column are defined in the _events.json sidecar as HED tags. When annotations are observed in particular EEG channels, the relevant channels is annotated by including a channel column in the events.tsv file.

- sub-ieegModulator    Intracranial EEG dataset collected at Mayo Clinic Rochester, MN during photic stimulation. The photic stimulation is annotated using the HED-SCORE modulator.
