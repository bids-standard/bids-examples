## Overview

These data were acquired as part of the Big GABA project, a large-scale multi-site study to determine differences in the measurement outcomes from GABA-edited and non-edited single-voxel MRS data across the three major MRI manufacturers: GE, Philips, and Siemens. The data here are only from one site (P3). Please visit the [Big GABA data repository](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/biggaba/) and refer to the publications above for more information.

Data types included are T1-weighted structural MRI images and single-voxel PRESS and GABA-edited MEGA-PRESS MRS data. The MEGA-PRESS data were acquired using standard GABA editing (TE = 68 ms) and symmetric macromolecule suppression (TE = 80 ms).

## Methods

### Subjects

Twelve healthy adults (7 males, 5 females, mean age = 29 years).

### MR protocol

MR data were acquired using a 3T Philips Achieva (Philips Healthcare, Eindhoven, Netherlands) system using a body coil for transmit and a 32-channel phased-array head coil for receive.

#### MRI

T1-weighted structural MRI acquisition parameters:

- Voxel resolution = 1 × 1 × 1 mm<sup>3</sup>
- TE/TI/TR (ms) = 3.1/865/6.9
- Scan duration = 7 min 10 s
- Flip angle = 8°
- Slices =  204
- FOV = 256 × 256 mm<sup>2</sup>
- Matrix size = 256 × 256 × 204
- SENSE acceleration factor = 2

#### MRS

General MRS acquisition parameters:

- Volume of interest = medial parietal lobe
- Voxel resolution = 30 × 30 × 30 mm<sup>3</sup>
- Spectral width = 2000 Hz
- Number of points = 2048

##### PRESS

- TE/TR = 35/2000 ms
- Number of transients = 64

##### MEGA-PRESS

- TE/TR = 68 (for standard GABA editing) or 80 (for symmetric macromolecule suppression)/2000 ms
- Number of transients = 320
