	"Instructions": "You will now perform the FOOT stomping experiment for the sequence you studied at home (automatic): 434141243212. There is a total of 11 trials, so performing the sequence 11 times (once per trial). In between each trial there is a rest period of 20 seconds. During this rest you will hear a metronome sound, stomp the sequence according to this interval sound. Trials and rest periods are indicated with red(= trial) and white(= rest)fixation crosses presented on the screen. When the experiment starts you cannot talk anymore. Furthermore, it is important to stay still except for your right leg. Keep your eyes open (also during the rest periods). Before the start of each new trial the sequence will be shown on the screen. If you press any key, the experiment starts right away. It will start with a rest period. Whenever a RED fixation cross appears on the screen, you should start stomping the sequence. When ready: press any key to start the foot stomping experiment.",
