    "Instructions": "'You will hear a series of brief sounds. Two will be tones with different pitches and one will sound like static. Your job is to press the red button with your thumb when you hear the higher pitched tone only. Ignore the lower pitched tone and the static sound. We will play you a sample now to test the sound level. Please practice responding to the higher pitched tone so that we will know you understand the task. Please keep your eyes open and focused on the dot in the center of the screen.\u2019",
