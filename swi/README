Example SWI dataset

This dataset demonstrates the organization of susceptibility weighted imaging
(SWI) data in BIDS. It includes multi-echo gradient-echo (MEGRE) raw data with
magnitude and phase components, and derived SWI, minimum intensity projection
(minIP), and quantitative susceptibility map (Chimap) outputs.
