# A derivative using the 4S (Schaefer Supplemented with Subcortical Structures) atlas

This example includes atlas segmentations resampled into subject-specific spaces and/or resolutions.

The `sourcedata/atlas-4S` subdirectory contains the atlas files used to generate these derivatives.

Because this derivative dataset uses the `atlas-4S` entity,
a copy of the `atlas-4S_description.json` from the source atlas is also distributed.
