# 4S: Schaefer Supplemented with Subcortical Structures

This repository contains two resolutions (156, 256) of the 4S atlas,
which is the Schaefer 2018 cortical atlas supplemented with subcortical structures from other atlases.

The atlas is shared in MNI152NLin6Asym, MNI152NLin2009cAsym, MNIInfant:cohort-1, MNIInfant:cohort-2, and fsLR space.

There are also versions of the atlas warped to subject-specific spaces and/or resolutions in the `sub-<label>` directories.
