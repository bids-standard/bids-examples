  "BIDSVersion": "1.10.1",
  "DatasetType": "derivative",  
  "Description": "The Molecular Imaging Brain Atlas (MIBA) was generated by averaging SUVR intensity–normalized PET images from 296 florbetapir subjects (mean=76.1 years, SD=8.0 years). For further details, see the publication 'Building Multivariate Molecular Imaging Brain Atlases Using the NeuroMark PET Independent Component Analysis Framework.' Cognitively normal subject data were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).",
