  "Name": "MIBA Florbetapir Mean SUVR (MNI305 Space, 2 mm)",
  "Description": "Group-level PET atlas generated from 296 cognitively normal subjects in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Images were acquired using 18F-florbetapir PET with four 5-minute frames per subject, SUVR-normalized using the whole cerebellum as the reference region, then spatially normalized to MNI305 space (2 mm isotropic resolution) and averaged. The resulting atlas represents mean SUVR values across all subjects.",
