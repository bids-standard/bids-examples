MIBA Florbetaben Mean SUVR (296 cognitively normal subjects, mean age 76.1 years)
=================================================================================

Overview
--------
The Molecular Imaging Brain Atlas (MIBA) was generated by averaging SUVR intensity–normalized 8.0 years). 
Cognitively normal subject data were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI, Version ADNI 3). The atlas is in MNI305 space and represents a group-level 
template.

Data Description
----------------
This derivatives dataset contains:

- PET atlas image in MNI305 space (2 mm resolution), mean SUVR values.
- Associated metadata JSON file describing tracer, processing steps, and source data.
- TSV file with detailed descriptions of atlas components.
- BIDS-compliant `dataset_description.json` and this `README.txt`.

Processing Summary
------------------
Source images were:
- Acquired as four 5-minute frames per subject.
- SUVR-normalized using the whole cerebellum as the reference region.
- Spatially normalized to MNI305 space.
- Averaged across subjects to form the final atlas.
