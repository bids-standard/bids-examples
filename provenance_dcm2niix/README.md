# Provenance of DICOM to Nifti conversion with `dcm2niix`

## Goal

This example aims at showing provenance metadata for a DICOM to Nifti conversion with [`dcm2niix`](https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix
). Provenance metadata was created manually ; its acts as a guideline for further machine-generated provenance by `dcm2niix`. 

## Source data

That the `sourcedata/` directory contains the source dataset (DICOM files) known as [hirni-demo](https://github.com/psychoinformatics-de/hirni-demo).

## Directory tree

After conversion, and adding provenance traces, the directory tree is as follows. Files marked with a ✍️ were generated manually.
`sub-02/anat/sub-02_T1w.json` was generated by `dcm2niix`, then the `GeneratedBy` and `SidecarGeneratedBy` provenance-related fields were added manually.
