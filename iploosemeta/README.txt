This exemplar dataset has not at time of writing been contributed
or proposed to any version of the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) specification.
It was created to demonstrate that it is possible for a metadata file to be present
yet not applicable to any data file;
it is unclear at time of writing whether this violates BIDS more generally,
however the Inheritance Principle as currently written does not forbid it.
This exemplar dataset should however produce a warning regarding such:
file "sub-01/anat/sub-01_T2w.json" is not applicable to any data file.
