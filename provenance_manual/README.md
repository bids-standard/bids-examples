# Provenance of manual brain segmentations

https://www.itksnap.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Main.HomePage

## Goal

This example aims at showing provenance metadata for a study dataset in which several experts performed manual brain segmentations from the same T1w file.

## Directory tree

> [!NOTE]
> Note that the `docs/` directory contains explanatory data (see [Provenance as a RDF graph](#provenance-as-a-rdf-graph)) that is not required to encode provenance.

```

```

## Provenance as a RDF graph

Provenance metadata can be aggregated as a JSON-LD RDF graph, which is available in [`docs/prov-seg.jsonld`](docs/prov-seg.jsonld). This is a rendered version of the graph, also available in [`docs/prov-seg.png`](docs/prov-seg.png).
