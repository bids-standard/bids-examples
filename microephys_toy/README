Example Microelectrode Electrophysiology Dataset
=================================================

This example dataset demonstrates the BIDS microelectrode electrophysiology 
(microephys) specification for both extracellular (ecephys) and intracellular 
(icephys) recordings.

Features Demonstrated
---------------------

This dataset demonstrates the following key features:

* **Registration to Allen CCF v3 space**: Electrode positions are provided in 
  Allen Common Coordinate Framework v3 (see space-AllenCCFv3 files)
  
* **Multiple probes in a single subject**: sub-mouse01 uses two probes 
  simultaneously (probe01 and probe02) targeting different brain regions
  
* **Probe defined in ProbeInterface Library**: probe01 uses the 
  A1x32-Poly3-10mm-50-177 model from the ProbeInterface library, referenced 
  via TermURL in the probes.json sidecar
  
* **Probe defined using a custom ProbeInterface definition**: probe02 uses a 
  custom probe definition stored in the probes/ directory, referenced via 
  BIDS URI (bids::probes/customprobe1.json)

Dataset Structure
-----------------

The dataset contains two subjects:

- sub-mouse01: Extracellular electrophysiology (ecephys) recordings
  - Session 1: Two recording sessions with different tasks
  - Uses two silicon probes:
    - probe01: NeuroNexus A1x32 (32 electrodes) in left motor cortex
    - probe02: Custom 16-channel probe in right hippocampus CA1
  
- sub-mouse02: Intracellular electrophysiology (icephys) recordings
  - Patch-clamp recordings from identified neurons
  - Current-clamp and voltage-clamp recordings

Data Format
-----------

All electrophysiology data is stored in NWB format (.nwb files). 
Note: In this example, placeholder .nwb files are used to demonstrate 
the file structure. In a real dataset, these would contain actual 
neural recording data.

Metadata Files
--------------

Each recording includes:
- *_probes.tsv: Information about recording probes/pipettes
- *_probes.json: Probe model definitions with ProbeInterface references
- *_electrodes.tsv: Electrode positions and properties
- *_channels.tsv: Recording channel configurations
- *_ecephys.json or *_icephys.json: Recording parameters and metadata
- *_events.tsv: Event timing for task-related recordings
- *_coordsystem.json: Coordinate system information (Allen CCF v3)
