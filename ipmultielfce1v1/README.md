This dataset exemplifies an issue whereby the 1.x version of the specification
has difficulty in capturing data wherein there are multiple intersecting
Entity-Lined File Collections.

In this version 1 of the dataset, every data file has associated with it a sidecar JSON.
In sister dataset "ipmultielfce1v2", an alternative encoding of this example is shown,
which is predicated on a more flexible ruleset for the Inheritance Principle.
