Example Microelectrode Electrophysiology Dataset
=================================================

This example dataset demonstrates the BIDS microelectrode electrophysiology 
(microephys) specification for both extracellular (ecephys) and intracellular 
(icephys) recordings.

Dataset Structure
-----------------

The dataset contains two subjects:

- sub-mouse01: Extracellular electrophysiology (ecephys) recordings
  - Session 1: Two recording sessions with different tasks
  - Uses a silicon probe (Neuropixels-like) with 32 electrodes
  
- sub-mouse02: Intracellular electrophysiology (icephys) recordings
  - Patch-clamp recordings from identified neurons
  - Current-clamp and voltage-clamp recordings

Data Format
-----------

All electrophysiology data is stored in NWB format (.nwb files). 
Note: In this example, placeholder .nwb files are used to demonstrate 
the file structure. In a real dataset, these would contain actual 
neural recording data.

Metadata Files
--------------

Each recording includes:
- *_probes.tsv: Information about recording probes/pipettes
- *_electrodes.tsv: Electrode positions and properties
- *_channels.tsv: Recording channel configurations
- *_ecephys.json or *_icephys.json: Recording parameters and metadata
- *_events.tsv: Event timing for task-related recordings
