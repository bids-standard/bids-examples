Dataset description
===================

This dataset includes recordings for a patient that was not reported in the above article, but are part of the same study. 
The patient presents a focal epilepsy of the left temporo-occipital junction, MRI-negative, and was implanted in the surrounding areas. 
It includes the recordings of three seizures, all of them showing a propagation of high-frequency oscillations from the lesion towards
the temporal lobe, bilaterally.

The depth electrodes used in this example dataset are DIXI D08-**AM Microdeep electrodes, with the following specifications:
    Diameter: 0.8 mm
    Contact length: 2 mm
    Insulator length: 1.5 mm
    Distance between the center of two contacts: 3.5 mm
    Between 8 and 18 contacts on each electrode 

Files included in this package:
    T1 MRI before SEEG implantation
    T1 MRI after SEEG implantation
    Cortical surface extracted with BrainVISA 4.5
    Positions of the SEEG contacts in various formats (MNI or subject space)
    Seizure recordings in BrainVision format, one seizure per file
    MRI scans were de-identified with FreeSurfer's mri_deface. 

This dataset was initially packaged for the Brainstorm and ImagGIN tutorials "SEEG epileptogenicity maps":
