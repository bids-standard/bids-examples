    "Name": "Juelich atlas",
    "Description": "Probabilistic cytoarchitectonic atlas based on microscopic and quantitative histological examination of ten human post-mortem brains. The atlas contains 52 grey matter structures and 10 white matter structures defined by cyto- and myelo-architectonic segmentations. Maps were 3D reconstructed and spatially normalized into MNI space. The atlas is part of the Julich-Brain project, a continuously expanding ('living') atlas with over 200 brain regions.",
